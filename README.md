steps taken are

1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of CT scan or X-ray images along with their corresponding disease labels.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the collected images to standardize their size, resolution, and format. 
   Normalize the pixel values and perform any required image enhancement techniques. 
3. Model Training: Train a CNN model on the preprocessed dataset. CNNs are particularly effective for image analysis tasks due to their ability to capture spatial features.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tune the model if necessary to improve its accuracy.
