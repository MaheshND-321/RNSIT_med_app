# RNSIT HackeOverflow Project README

Welcome to the README file for the RNSIT HackeOverflow project! This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for diagnosing diseases from medical images, specifically CT scan or X-ray images. The goal is to build an accurate classification model that can predict diseases based on the images.

## Project Overview

The RNSIT HackeOverflow project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to develop an efficient disease diagnosis system using medical images. By training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on a dataset of CT scan or X-ray images, the project seeks to classify these images based on their corresponding disease labels. This can potentially aid medical professionals in accurate and timely diagnosis.

## Data Collection

For this project, a dataset of CT scan or X-ray images along with their associated disease labels needs to be collected. This dataset will serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the model's performance. Care should be taken to ensure the dataset is diverse, representative, and properly labeled.

## Data Preprocessing

The collected images must undergo preprocessing before being used to train the model. This involves:
- Standardizing image size and resolution.
- Normalizing pixel values to a common scale.
- Applying image enhancement techniques if necessary.

Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flipping, and zooming, can also be applied to increase the diversity of the dataset and improve model generalization.

## Model Training

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial features in images. A CNN model should be designed and trained using the preprocessed dataset. The model architecture can include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

## Model Evaluation

The trained model's performance needs to be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics will provide insights into the model's effectiveness in disease classification. If the model's performance is not satisfactory, it may be necessary to fine-tune hyperparameters or adjust the model architecture.
